# 🥘 1.3 Billion Tons of Food Wasted Every Year – While Millions Go Hungry  
### Why? Because the right systems don’t exist.  

That’s why we built **Nourish AI** – not just a project, but a bridge that connects surplus food to those who need it.  

🚀 **Designed and built during two hackathons**, we transformed an idea into a scalable solution that brings:  
✅ Real-time food redistribution  
✅ AI-powered zero-waste solutions  
✅ Transparency, tracking & accountability  
✅ Gamification to boost engagement 🎮🏆
